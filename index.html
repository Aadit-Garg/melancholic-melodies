                All my grim fears win over my night

                <br>

                Now reveling in mind, showing

                <br>

                me, jumping from height

                <br>

                me, losing the one I hold tight

                <br>

                me, being buried without light

                <br>

                me, lost in the deepest of me

                <br>



                <br>

                Those vicious made me eye,

                <br>

                The I, I fear

                <br>

                The scene, I averse

                <br>

                The life, I distaste

                <br>

                The person, I am

                <br>

                Still, whom to blame

                Either you rely or maybe try

                <br>

                Both lead to cry,

                Fact that I lack try

                <br>

                But i try to try

                The girl laid in her bed mellow,

                Thinking of the boy in yellow,

                <br>

                “Was she eager about him?”,

                <br>

                Thought she all night till brim.

                It’s the boy now in his bed, lil’ mad,

                <br>

                Feeling a little sad,

                <br>

                Got no idea what’s happening,

                <br>

                Thinking, the life’s blackening.

                <br>



                <br>

                Something’s going to happen,

                <br>

                Maybe there gap going to dampen,

                <br>

                The rest is upon you to decide,

                <br>

                Make choices that are wise.

                <br>

                with me was the spirit of yours

                <br>

                we had a lot of talk

                <br>

                I got all the answers I wonder for

                <br>

                you told me I am the desperate one

                <br>

                You told me you hate it with me

                <br>

                You dont wanna talk,

                <br>



                <br>

                I took it as sarcasm

                <br>

                I told everything I hold you account for

                <br>

                Its just that you changed me a lot

                <br>

                Its not only you

                <br>

                who left me all alone

                <br>

                We talked about the night we star-gazed

                <br>

                but honestly I was just looking at you all along

                <br>



                <br>

                Hints you gave me laying,

                <br>

                then said it was nothing

                <br>

                lying is what you did at all

                <br>

                It was happy being with you

                <br>

                I am the one who got it all wrong

                <br>

                I wanna focus now not fight

                <br>

                he was crying, they both hugged

                <br>



                <br>

                I blinked once more

                <br>

                I saw her dressing me for the day

                <br>

                I saw him clicking pictures

                <br>

                and making me smile

                <br>

                it all went for a while

                <br>



                <br>

                I blinked again

                <br>

                now I can't see her or him

                <br>

                but what I saw gave me cries

                <br>

                it was a divine beauty

                <br>

                which gave butterflies

                <br>



                <br>

                I blinked for the fourth

                <br>

                It was all black

                <br>

                I remember!

                <br>

                it was my birthday in september

                <br>

                they gave me a surprise made of lumber

                <br>



                <br>

                I wish to blink more, but scared to know

                <br>

                if it holds any good to me

                <br>

                If I recall, it's where the obscene episode is

                <br>

                the one which I don't wanna remember

                <br>

                its my stop now I should leave
                <br>

                Standing at the convergence,

                Should I take "the road not taken"

                <br>

                Or the one striding,

                <br>

                <br>

                The chance taken was the striding,

                <br>

                But in my mind I took the lurking one,

                <br>

                I took what was destined,

                <br>

                But what matters is,

                <br>

                Wasn't planned at all

                The fate we share,

                The feelings I had,

                Was something I never told

                <br>



                <br>

                It's the banter,

                <br>

                which is left with "doré"

                <br>

                Truth then exchanged,

                <br>

                was it the one I was hoping for?

                In our eyes it came to a halt,

                <br>

                it's where I am stuck too

                The sorries I never said,

                Are still here, roams in my head

                The regrets I have,

                Are still on the list waiting to be checked

                The things I blame myself for,
